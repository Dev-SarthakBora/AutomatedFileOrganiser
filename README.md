A **Python-based file organizer** that automatically sorts files into categorized folders using only standard libraries. Keep your directories neat and structured effortlessly!

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically categorizes files into folders such as:
  - **Images** (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`)
  - **Excel** (`.csv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`)
  - **PDFs**, **Word**, **PowerPoint**
  - **Audio & Video**
  - **Code files** (`.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.html`, `.css`, etc.)
  - **Archives** (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`)
  - **Text files** (`.txt`, `.md`, `.log`)
  - **Others** (uncategorized extensions)
- Utilities included:
  - **Organize files** into their respective folders
  - **Truncate folder** (delete all files & subfolders)
  - **Generate sample files** for testing

## ⚡ How It Works

1. Place all your files in a folder (e.g., `D:\files`).  
2. Run the script to automatically create folders for each category.  
3. Files are scanned, categorized by extension, and moved to their respective folders.  
4. Unknown file types are moved into an **Others** folder.
